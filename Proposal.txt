# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Its... Chess?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A 2 player normal chess game but pieces can do different moves than normal in that specific. For example: The knight piece can only move like a bishop


TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will create pieces and attribute possible moves to them. And when the user tries to move the piece I will make sure that my program checks what attribute the piece and sees if the move is possible.

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Getting the whole game of chess

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Getting the unique pieces that can move several ways or in different ways than before

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be doing more, adding many variants, possibly another gamemode such as having 3 kings to protect

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research how to place basic sprites down. I think it is a realistic goal due to the fact that chess is a grid so I will not need to think so hard in that aspect. I could possibly use turtle just like what the Hurricane project did.
